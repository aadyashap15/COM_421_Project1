Sustainable Info Structure Project

PROJECT SELF CRITIQUE:

In this project, I aimed to create an intuitive information structure that organizes content in a modular way, making each section accessible through a top-level navigation bar. I have also used in-page hyperlinking to redirect users to specific content in long pages like the "Research" module. The structure reflects a logical flow, moving from general information (like Home and Topic) to more specific guidance in sections like Research, Data, and References. I used consistent styling across pages to ensure a cohesive experience and to reinforce the site’s focus on usability.

If given more time, I would enhance the site’s interactivity by incorporating JavaScript for dynamic navigation, like highlighting active pages automatically and implementing smooth scroll effects for “Back to Top” links. Additionally, adding a search function to improve content findability would benefit users exploring multiple modules. I’d also focus on accessibility improvements, such as better screen reader support and ensuring optimal color contrast. Overall, the current structure provides a strong foundation, but these additions would elevate user experience and accessibility.
